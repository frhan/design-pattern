Cross-origin resource sharing
===

CORS defines a way in which a browser and server can interact to determine whether or not it is safe to allow the cross-origin request

* For security reasons, browsers restrict cross-origin HTTP requests initiated from within scripts. For example, **XMLHttpRequest** and **the Fetch API** follow the _same-origin policy_.

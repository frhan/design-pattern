# File Security

## Password-Based Protection

- Every user of a Linux-based computer system is assigned a login name (a name by which the user is known to the Linux system) and a password.
- All login names are public knowledge and can be found in the `/etc/passwd` file

## Protection Based on Access Permission

## Types of Users

- Each user in a Linux system belongs to a group of users
- A user can belong to multiple groups, but a typical Linux user belongs to a single group.
- All the groups in the system and their memberships are listed in the file `/etc/group`
- Comprise the three types of users of a Linux file: _user, group, and others_.
- The login name for the superuser is root and the user ID is 0.

The first field specifies the group name, the second specifies some information about the group, the third specifies the group ID as a number, and the last specifies a comma-separated list of users who are mem- bers of the group.

- The default group mem- bership of a user is specified in the userâ€™s entry in the `/etc/passwd` file

## Types of File Operations/Access Permissions

### Access Permissions for Directories

- The read permission for a directory allows you to read the contents of the directory; recall that the contents of a directory are the names of files and directories in it. Thus, the ls command can be used to list its con- tents.
- The write permission for a directory allows you to create a new directory or a file in it or to remove an existing entry from it
- The execute permission for a directory is permission to search the directory but not to read from or write to it.

- If an argument of the `ls -l` command is a directory, the command displays the long list of all the files and directories in it.
- the ls -ld command to display the long list of directories only.

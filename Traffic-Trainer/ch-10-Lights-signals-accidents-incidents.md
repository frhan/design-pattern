# Lights, signals, accidents & incidents

## **Page 1/7**

### Lights

- during **daylight** hours the purpose of your vehicle's lights is to **be seen** more than actually seeing yourself!
- passenger cars - registered after February 7th 2011 - must be fitted with daytime running lights (drl's)
- These drl's may only be used during daytime and not in combination with other front lights.
- you must use dipped beam headlights during dull daytime weather, poor visibility, at night and in tunnels.

## **Page 2/7**

### Required and optional lighting

Required lighting that has to be present and functioning at the front:

- 2 daytime running lights (new cars only).

- 2 white or yellow coloured front side lights.

- 2 white or yellow coloured dipped beam headlights.

- 2 white or yellow coloured main beam headlights (also referred to as full beam headlights).

- 2 white or orange coloured front indicator lights.
Hazard warning lights (these will operate at the front and rear)

Required lighting that has to be present and functioning at the rear:

- 2 red rear lights.

- 2 red or orange coloured rear brake lights.

- 1 centrally mounted red rear brake light.
Brake lights may only be lit when operating the foot brake pedal.

- 2 red or orange coloured rear indicator lights.

- 1 red coloured rear fog lamp.

- 1 white coloured reversing light; 
May only be lit when the reverse gear is engaged.

- White rear registration plate lighting that does not beam 
rearwards.

- 2 red rear fitted retroreflectors.

**all lamps, including lenses and reflectors, must be in working order, even in daylight hours.**

### The use of lights

#### Sidelights

used as a collective word for the:

- Front sidelights, generally 2 lamps.
- Rear lights, two or more lamps (also referred to as tail lights).
- Rear registration plate lighting, one or two lamps.

#### Sidelights when driving

When using your **_main beam headlights, dipped beam headlights, front sidelights or fog lights_**

- ensure that your rear lights and rear registration plate are lit.

#### Sidelights when stopped or parked

- On the carriageway of a road outside the built-up area.
- On parking bays or lanes, hard shoulders and emergency areas when alongside motorroads (autowegen) and motorways (autosnelwegen).

### Headlights

#### Dipped beam headlights

- During dull daytime weather seriously reducing visibility, poor visibility in general, at night and in tunnels you must use your dipped beam headlights

#### Main beam headlights

use full beam headlights instead of  dipped beam headlights except:

- During daytime.
- When meeting oncoming road users, including pedestrians.
- When following another vehicle at a short distance, including pedal cyclists and moped riders.

When driving at night and being dazzled by the main beam headlights

- set your interior mirror to the anti-dazzle mode.

blue warning light on the dashboard warns that you have your main beam headlights lit

### Important

- main beam headlights are only allowed at night

### Fog lights

#### Front fog lights (optional)

Front fog lights may be used when visibility is seriously reduced (generally to less than 200 meters) due to:

- rain
- fog
- snowfall

You are allowed to use your front fog lights, either with or without using your dipped beam headlights

When using front fog lights, you **must** also always use the dipped beam headlights and the main beam headlights only when permitted.

You **may** also switch your dipped beam headlights off and then just drive with the front fog lights **together** with the front sidelights, the rear lights and the rear registration plate lighting

### Rear Fog lights (one is required/a second is optional)

- One rear fog light is part of your lighting requirements by law

One or two rear fog lights may be used

- visibility is seriously reduced to less than 50 meters
- Very dense (thick) fog.
- Heavy snowfall.

When using one or two rear fog lights you **must** always ensure that your rear lights and rear registration plate are lit.

When using one or two rear fog lights, you **must** also always use the dipped beam headlights and the main beam headlights only when permitted

**Note that the yellow warning light on the dashboard warns that you have your rear fog light(s) lit.**

### Hazard warning lights

hazard warning lights should be used to warn 

- vehicle is on tow
- broken down.
- vehicle is parked dangerously.
- stationary where hardly visible.
- slowing down quickly upon approaching queueing traffic.

### The optional advance red warning triangle

- Drivers using the hazard warning lights may choose not to use triangle.

- If used, this advance red warning triangle should be placed on the road surface at about 30 meters from the obstacle and in the direction of the approaching traffic.

- triangles fold flat - legally obliged to have one though!

### Place the triangle

- On a straight level, road put the triangle at about 30 meters from your vehicle.
- On a very narrow road put the triangle on the nearside verge or footpath.
- On a winding or hilly road, put the triangle where drivers will see it before they have to deal with any bend or hump in the road.

### Other optional lights

Drivers of motor vehicles may, when using:

- Dipped beam headlights or
- Front fog lights

### Direction indicator signals

### Using direction indicator signals at priority bends

when following or leaving:

- a priority bend
- a through carriageway
in general use of the direction indicator will be required.

Snorfietsers (light mopeds) and bromfietsers (mopeds) may also give an audible warning signal by means of a bell.

## Using warning signals

## **Page 3/7**

### A summary of using the direction indicator and warning signals

### Dashboard warning lights

#### Colour is important

- A **red** warning light indicates either a potentially serious problem or safety issue
- a red light might also serve as a reminder about service maintenance
- When a **yellow or orange** light activates, it's usually a signal that a component needs servicing or repair
- **Green and/or blue** dashboard lights only serve to let you know that a system is active and operating.

### About using the direction indicators (commonly referred to as 'signalling')

**Conflicting signals** - a signal with the right indicator means ‘I'm going to turn right’ or ‘I'm going to stop on the right’.

- Wait until you've passed the junction then indicate that you intend to stop.
- Reduce speed by breaking gently so that your brake lights warn drivers behind you.

- If your vehicle is not fitted with direction indicators, like on some (light) mopeds, you indicate direction with your arm.

- where inside the built-up area a deceleration lane or a lane for positioning is present it will be sufficient to indicate direction at about 50 meters before the exit or junction.

### Hazard warning lights

### Signs at level crossings

Level crossings can be divided into the following types:

- Guarded level crossings, warning sign J10.
- Unguarded level crossings, warning sign J11.

AHOB - automatic half-way protection by barriers
ADOB -  twin flashing red stop lights and an audible alarm.

- Each red diagonal bar represents a distance of 80 meters.

**never stop or park, on, or near a crossing**

### Road traffic accidents and incidents

the scene of an accident you should assist in accordance with the so called PAMAN rules.

### The Rautek grip

- There are obvious dangers for victims with spinal injuries or osteoporosis, therefore victims should be moved only if the situation absolutely requires it (e.g., in a fire).

Make sure you have the following information when calling 1-1-2:

- Location of the accident.
- Sort of accident (possible vehicles).
- If there are injured people involved, the number of casualties

When you have been **involved** in a road traffic accident, even without having received any damage or injury yourself, you are still not allowed to just drive off.

you are still granted a grace period of up to 12 hours within which you must still supply this information

Leaving the scene of an accident, even walking away, in which you are involved or of which you are partially or wholly the cause is a criminal offence

### First-Aid on the road



## NTK

- It is better to switch the lights, e.g. the sidelights and the dipped beam headlights, of your vehicle on after having started the engine; in this case you will not be draining the battery unnecessarily.

- sidelights will not make your vehicle more noticeable to others.

- Drivers of motorvehicles on more than two wheels when stationary (stopping or parking) on the CARRIAGEWAY outside the built-up area during the daytime, under conditions of poor visibility, and at night must use the sidelights (two small front white lights and two small rear or tail lights). This does NOT apply to verges! 

- YELLOW warning light indicates that you should check the oil level as soon as possible and top up if necessary. Case in point: if a RED warning light shows up whilst driving you should stop as soon as possible and switch the engine off. That red warning light can indicate a too low oil pressure; driving on can seriously damage your engine!

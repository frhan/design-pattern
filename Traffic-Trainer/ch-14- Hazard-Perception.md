Hazard perception in the theory test
In this test a hazard is defined as anything that causes the driver to brake, release the accelerator or to do nothing.

Hazard perception aims in scanning the road, recognising at the first opportunity from the clues that a potentially dangerous situation might arise and adopting a driving plan to reduce the risk.

## NTK
- When refuelling during warm and hot weather you should pay more attention to the fuel level in your tank, so as not to accidentally overfill/spill (environmental violation). Petrol expands by approximately 1-2% when it is warmed; you'll get denser petrol when you fill when it is cool versus hot

- Points of attention here should be: 1: your speed. 2: a reasonably clear road ahead. 3: a good range of vision. 4: no following driver

- by RELEASE THE ACCELERATOR we mean release the accelerator to reduce your speed gradually, e.g. to obtain a better overview of a traffic situation, to pass another road user in a safe manner or to slightly increase the distance to a preceding vehicle. Releasing the accelerator will only give you a slight speed reduction at first, whereas if the pedal is released for a longer period of time the reduction of your speed will be much more noticeable.

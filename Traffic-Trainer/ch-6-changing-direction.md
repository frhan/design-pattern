# Changing direction

## **page 1/11**

### Signalling or using the direction indicator

The approximate distances at which the direction indicator must be used are for:

- Motorways/motorroads outside the built-up area - 300 meters before the beginning of the deceleration lane
- Motorroads inside the built-up area - 100 meters before the beginning of the deceleration lane
- Roads inside the built-up area (50 km/h roads - 100 meters before the junction
- Roads outside the built-up area and 70 km/h roads - 150 meters before the junction
- Roads in residential areas (home/30 km/h zones) - 50 meters before the junction

### Using turning lanes (lanes with arrows)

- Once chosen, these arrows give you a direction that you must follow.

### Positioning lanes for ahead

These lanes can also be marked for ahead only

## **Page 2/11**

### Turning right

### Road position

- Where a suggested cycle lane, i.e. a lane with no painted cycle symbol on the road surface, is present you may take up a position on the road in that suggested cycle lane.

### Observation technique

- Look
- Indicate right - only signal when you are sure
- Look again
- Take up a position on the road

_No bromfietsen (mopeds) or brommobielen (mobility cars)_ on cycle lanes.

Bromfietsen and brommobielen must use the carriageway

when present, bromfietsen must use the combined cycle/moped paths (sign G12a).

### Speed on approach

## **page 3/11**

### Turning left

### Road position

- Position yourself as close to the centre of the road as is safe, so that other drivers can overtake on your right if thereâ€™s enough space.
- In a one-way street, where there is no vehicle contra-flow, move to the left-hand side of the road when appropriate.

### Observation technique

- Look
- Indicate left
- Look again
- Take up a position on the road

### Oncoming traffic

- You should give the right of way to traffic continuing straight ahead; this also means you have to give the right of way to those crossing the road that you are turning into, including pedestrians.

- when you are between the solid white lines or level with the directional arrows on the road surface you must not change direction anymore. These arrows give you a direction that you must then follow.

## **page 4/11**

### The advanced stop line (OFOS)

- Note that all other drivers, including bromfietsers (moped riders) and brommobielen (mobility cars), may not use this area but must stop at the first white, or yellow if temporary, line reached.

### The priority bends

- sub-plate the thick black bar represents the direction in which the priority continues and the smaller black bars represent the side roads leading into this priority bend.

- when driving on a priority road and reaching a junction or a crossing a tram approaching from your right or left must give way to you!

- a tram approaching you from your front or rear - i.e. also travelling on the priority road - and turning to its left or right does have priority.



## NTK

- when pulling caravans/trailers with a maximum authorized mass (MAM) of less than 3500 kg, the maximum speed is 90 km/h; if the MAM is more than 3500 kg, the maximum speed is 80 km/h.

- When performing a special manoeuvre, e.g. stopping, parking, turning round, pulling off etc., you may not impede any other road users in the immediate vicinity

- remember that trams may be overtaken on either side. Normally a tram will be overtaken on the right, but when and where this is not possible or suitable overtaking on the left is allowed

- When passengers are still boarding a bus, the bus must remain stationary and cannot drive off; to avoid stemming the flow of traffic you should drive past, i.e. overtake, this bus if there is sufficient room

- Drivers on the extreme right or left lane of their carriageway and closely following another driver, must not overtake that driver when he has made his intention to turn off known and has taken up a position to do so.

- Once you have positioned your vehicle in a lane and are level with the directional arrows showing the direction to be followed, you may not change lanes anymore and follow a different direction. 

- You must not overtake any other vehicle at or near a VOP (Voetgangers Oversteek Plaats = pedestrian crossing). 

- overtaking sight distance or overtaking vision is the minimum distance open to the vision of the driver of a vehicle intending to overtake a slow vehicle ahead safely against the traffic in the opposite direction. This distance is measured along the centre line of the road over which a driver with his eye level 1.2 m above the road surface can see the top of an object 1.2 m above the road surface.

- You should overtake other vehicles on the left. As there was sufficient space here for overtaking safely, it is allowed.

- drivers wanting to overtake a preceding vehicle that has a) indicated the intention to turn left, and b) also taken up a position on the road for this purpose must overtake that vehicle on the right only.

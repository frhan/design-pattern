# Changing direction

## **page 1/11**

### Signalling or using the direction indicator

The approximate distances at which the direction indicator must be used are for:

- Motorways/motorroads outside the built-up area - 300 meters before the beginning of the deceleration lane
- Motorroads inside the built-up area - 100 meters before the beginning of the deceleration lane
- Roads inside the built-up area (50 km/h roads - 100 meters before the junction
- Roads outside the built-up area and 70 km/h roads - 150 meters before the junction
- Roads in residential areas (home/30 km/h zones) - 50 meters before the junction

### Using turning lanes (lanes with arrows)

- Once chosen, these arrows give you a direction that you must follow.

### Positioning lanes for ahead

These lanes can also be marked for ahead only

## **Page 2/11**

### Turning right

### Road position

- Where a suggested cycle lane, i.e. a lane with no painted cycle symbol on the road surface, is present you may take up a position on the road in that suggested cycle lane.

### Observation technique

- Look
- Indicate right - only signal when you are sure
- Look again
- Take up a position on the road

_No bromfietsen (mopeds) or brommobielen (mobility cars)_ on cycle lanes.

Bromfietsen and brommobielen must use the carriageway

when present, bromfietsen must use the combined cycle/moped paths (sign G12a).

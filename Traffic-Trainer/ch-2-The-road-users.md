### Road placement for pedestrians

Pedestrians use either:
- the pavement or
- the footpath

In the absence of either the pavement or footpath they use:

- the compulsory pedal cycle path (verplicht fietspad) or
- the compulsory combined pedal cycle/moped path (verplicht fiets-bromfietspad)

Where also a pedal cycle path or a combined pedal cycle/moped path is absent, they use:
- the verge or
- the extreme side of the carriageway, which can also be a cycle lane

categories of road users can either be classed as pedestrians or drivers, depending on their use of the road:

### Category 1: Invalid carriages
classed as pedestrians when using the pavement or footpath and also when crossing from one pavement or footpath to another. Note that in this case their speed is limited to 6 km/h.

When these persons are not using the pavement or footpath, but the cycle path or carriageway they are classed as drivers. 

### an invalid carriage
- a maximum width of 1.10 m, a maximum length of 3.50 m and a maximum height of 2.00 m
- They are constructed for a maximum speed of 45 km/h and are not fitted with a registration plate, but must have a rear insurance plate.

### Category 2: Groups of pedestrians
Groups of pedestrians, e.g. convoys, funeral and other processions, marching columns and parades on foot, when following the carriageway, must follow the regulations applicable to the drivers of carts.

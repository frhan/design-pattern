### Basic rules for road positioning

- Keep to the right as much as possible
- A cyclist rides on the pedal cycle path, a motorist drives on the carriageway and a pedestrian walks on the footpath or pavement.

### Vulnerable road users

- Pedestrians must use the footpath or pavement, when present
- in the absence of such the pedestrian is also allowed to use the pedal cycle path or the combined pedal cycle/moped path
- When also these are not present the pedestrian is allowed to use the verge or the far side of the carriageway as a last resort.

#### only two exceptions to the rule that the same road user can only be a pedestrian or a driver:

- Category 1: Persons using an invalid carriage,i.e Canta or similar, a manual or powered wheelchair a mobility scooter - are classed as pedestrians when using the pavement or footpath.

- Category 2: roups of pedestrians, e.g. convoys, funeral and other processions, marching columns and parades on foot, must follow the regulations applicable to the drivers of carts

_Fietsers (pedal cyclists), snorfietsers (light moped riders), 
bromfietsers (moped riders) and drivers of invalid carriages_:

- must use the combined compulsory pedal cycle/moped path
- when absent, moped riders must use the carriageway
- pedal cyclists, light moped riders and drivers of invalid carriages use the compulsory pedal cycle path or cycle lanes on the carriageway.

_Equestrians (horse riders)_ must ride on a bridle path (horse track)

- absence of such a path they must ride in the verge or ride on the carriageway.

Drivers of _motorvehicles, e.g. passenger cars, commercial vehicles, vans, light and heavy goods vehicles, buses, coaches, and brommobielen (mobility cars)_ must use the carriageway.

### Roads

- The carriageway is a part of the road, but so is the (grass) verge!

### Carriageways

## **Page 3/18**

### Visibility of the road

- reflector posts, also called marker or verge posts, are placed in the verge alongside the carriageway.
- White reflector posts are always placed on the left side of the carriageway
- Red reflector posts are always placed on the right side of the carriageway.
- placed at 50 meter intervals on the respective side of the carriageway on roads 
- situated outside the built-up area

### Centrifugal force and banking of the road

- Positive banking is used the most. outside is higher than the inside in order to reduce the effects of centrifugal force.
- A negative banking - the road slopes downwards towards the outside (left side) of the corner and the forces acting on your vehicle could cause it to leave the road more easily than on a normal road.

### Fietsers (pedal cyclists), bromfietsers (drivers of mopeds) and snorfietsers (drivers of light mopeds)

Fietsers (pedal cyclists), snorfietsers ((light moped riders), bromfietsers (moped riders) and drivers of invalid carriages have to use the combined compulsory pedal cycle/moped path; when absent, moped riders must use the carriageway and pedal cyclists, light moped riders and drivers of invalid carriages use the compulsory pedal cycle path or cycle lanes on the carriageway.

### The advanced stop line for cyclists (the “OFOS”)

- (OFOS) is Dutch for “Opgeblazen Fiets Opstel Strook”
- advanced stop lines to allow fietsers (pedal cyclists), snorfietsers (light moped riders) and invalid carriages to be positioned ahead of other traffic.

### Overtaking fietsers (pedal cyclists), bromfietsers (drivers of mopeds) and snorfietsers (drivers of light mopeds)

- Pedal cyclists may ride two abreast, i.e. next to one another.
- Bromfietsers (mopeds) and snorfietsers (light mopeds) may not ride next to each other; they must ride in a single file, i.e. behind each other

## NTK

- Pedal cyclists are permitted to cross both the broken and the solid white or yellow (temporary road markings) lines when wanting to overtaking or needing to divert suddenly. Case in point: remember that this action may only be undertaken if you do not endanger or impede any other road users.

- Brommobielen (mobility cars) and bromfietsen (mopeds) must not drive on a compulsory cycle path indicated by this sign (G11). Fietsers (pedal cyclists) and snorfietsen (light mopeds) must use this path; invalid carriages may make use of it. To all other drivers this path is closed. Case in point: brommobielen must use the carriageway and bromfietsers (mopeds) are only allowed on the combined compulsory fiets/bromfietspad (cycle/moped path), indicated by sign G12a! Note that both of these paths can also be used by invalid carriages, when they are not following the footpath or pavement.

### Basic rules for road positioning

- Keep to the right as much as possible
- A cyclist rides on the pedal cycle path, a motorist drives on the carriageway and a pedestrian walks on the footpath or pavement.

### Vulnerable road users

- Pedestrians must use the footpath or pavement, when present
- in the absence of such the pedestrian is also allowed to use the pedal cycle path or the combined pedal cycle/moped path
- When also these are not present the pedestrian is allowed to use the verge or the far side of the carriageway as a last resort.

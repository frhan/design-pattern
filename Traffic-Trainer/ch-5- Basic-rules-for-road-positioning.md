### Basic rules for road positioning

- Keep to the right as much as possible
- A cyclist rides on the pedal cycle path, a motorist drives on the carriageway and a pedestrian walks on the footpath or pavement.

### Vulnerable road users

- Pedestrians must use the footpath or pavement, when present
- in the absence of such the pedestrian is also allowed to use the pedal cycle path or the combined pedal cycle/moped path
- When also these are not present the pedestrian is allowed to use the verge or the far side of the carriageway as a last resort.

#### only two exceptions to the rule that the same road user can only be a pedestrian or a driver:

- Category 1: Persons using an invalid carriage,i.e Canta or similar, a manual or powered wheelchair a mobility scooter - are classed as pedestrians when using the pavement or footpath.

- Category 2: roups of pedestrians, e.g. convoys, funeral and other processions, marching columns and parades on foot, must follow the regulations applicable to the drivers of carts

_Fietsers (pedal cyclists), snorfietsers (light moped riders), 
bromfietsers (moped riders) and drivers of invalid carriages_:

- must use the combined compulsory pedal cycle/moped path
- when absent, moped riders must use the carriageway
- pedal cyclists, light moped riders and drivers of invalid carriages use the compulsory pedal cycle path or cycle lanes on the carriageway.

_Equestrians (horse riders)_ must ride on a bridle path (horse track)

- absence of such a path they must ride in the verge or ride on the carriageway.

Drivers of _motorvehicles, e.g. passenger cars, commercial vehicles, vans, light and heavy goods vehicles, buses, coaches, and brommobielen (mobility cars)_ must use the carriageway.

### Roads
- The carriageway is a part of the road, but so is the (grass) verge!

## NTK

- Pedal cyclists are permitted to cross both the broken and the solid white or yellow (temporary road markings) lines when wanting to overtaking or needing to divert suddenly. Case in point: remember that this action may only be undertaken if you do not endanger or impede any other road users.

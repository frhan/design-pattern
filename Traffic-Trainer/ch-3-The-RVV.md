- everyone is equally entitled to have a safe use of the road
- Traffic rules have to contribute to a safe, swift and environmentally friendly flow of traffic.

## **page 2/14**

### Signs

The basic rule of priority is: give the right of way to **all drivers** approaching from your right.

sign B7 you must always first bring your vehicle to a **full stop** before driving on, even when there is no traffic in sight.

## **page 3/14**

### Traffic lights

- Driving on  a “priority road” means that all the drivers approaching this road from the right and the left **must** give the right of way to all the drivers on this road.

- you must stop at the red light and give the right of way to drivers at the crossing road ahead

**traffic lights take precedence over traffic signs and traffic rules.**

### Signals by authorised persons

**ignals by authorised persons take precedence over traffic lights (signals), traffic signs (signs and road markings) and traffic rules (the general rules of behaviour).**

Therefore the hierarchy of this sytem is:

1. Signals given by authorised persons.
2. Traffic lights (signals).
3. Signs and road markings.
4. General rules of behaviour

## **page 4/14**

### Validity of road signs

- Road signs mostly apply to the whole width of the road.
- Signs which prohibit parking (sign E1) or stopping (sign E2), only apply to the side of the road on which the sign is placed.

- sign (F1) prohibits motorvehicles to overtake each other

## **page 5/14**

### Mobile roadworks units

All drivers must obey the indications shown by these mobile roadworks units, whether they are stationary or moving.

## **page 6/14**

### Road markings

- the more paint that is used, the more important the message will be

### The most important road markings

### Lines across the road

#### Stop line

#### Shark’s teeth

#### Double white speed zone lines

These white lines indicate the entry to and exit from 30 and 60 km/h speed zones

#### Double blue parking disc zone lines

These blue lines indicate the entry to and exit from a parking disc zone;

### Lines along the road

#### Solid white line

Drivers are not allowed to cross a solid white line which divides a carriageway into lanes

#### Solid and broken white lines

When driving on the side of the broken line, you may cross the lines to go to the other lane; when driving on the side of the solid line, you may not cross the lines

#### Broken yellow line

A broken yellow line means no parking; alongside a broken yellow line you may only stop for a moment for the purpose of picking up or setting down passengers or (un) loading goods

#### Solid yellow line

A solid yellow line means no stopping

#### Blue parking disc zone lines

These blue lines are placed alongside the parking bays and places within a parking disc zone

#### Hatch markings

Hatch markings define a dangerous areas where it is necessary to separate the streams of traffic completely, such as a sharp bend or hump, or where traffic turning needs protection

- you should not cross or drive on or over these markings.

### Other important road markings

#### Pedestrian crossing (also called a “zebra” crossing)

you have to give the right of way to pedestrians at or near this crossing with a clear intent to cross the street.

#### Turning lanes at junctions and crossings

- pedal cyclists and drivers of light-mopeds are allowed to use turning lanes, but it is not compulsory.

### Bus carriageways and bus lanes

- often buses will be sharing these carriageways with tram

- A "LIJNBUS" or "BUS" lane has a solid or broken boundary line on the carriageway. When the word "LIJNBUS" is shown, these may only be used by public transport buses, trams and taxis with a special license.

#### Zigzags

warn of a particular dangerous situation on the road ahead; this could be the narrowing of the road, the approach to a pedestrian crossing, the approach to a crossing point for pedestrians, pedal cyclists, light moped, mopeds, speed humps, cushions etc

#### Staircase markings

the road surface warn of a particular dangerous situation on the road ahead

### Merging point and Diverging point

- you must not cross these lines
- However there is one exception: when this point is situated in an open rush hour lane, drivers are allowed to follow this lane and drive across the white lines of these points.

#### Temporary road markings

- these take precedence over other white road markings.

## **page 7/14**

### Traffic lights (also referred to as signals)

Traffic lights can have three (green, yellow and red) or two (yellow and red) colours and are divided into two categories:

- Full traffic lights.
- Filter traffic lights.

### Full traffic lights (3-colours)

full traffic lights the oncoming traffic will also have full traffic lights, which meant that you’ll both have green at the same time.

The diagonally positioned arrows in these lights indicate that you should turn left at the second road, as the first road on your left will be the carriageway for the oncoming traffic.

### Filter traffic lights (3-colours)

- Filter traffic lights for all drivers display lights with a directional arrow

- At filter traffic lights you should expedite your turn and clear the crossing as soon as possible.

- Also note that filter lights generally change sooner than full lights

### Three exceptions to the rule

1. Military convoys
2. Priority vehicles 
3. Right turn on yellow/red

### Full or filter traffic lights (2-colours)

You’ll often see these 2-coloured traffic lights at places where the right of way needs to be regulated temporarily

### Yellow flashing lights

- Traffic lights which are out (of action or of order) often have a flashing yellow light. In such a situation it is important to approach that junction carefully.

- A single yellow flashing light warns of a dangerous situation ahead, where extra caution and a reduced speed will be required;

- Sign J32 often warns of traffic lights ahead; these can be filter or full traffic lights (signals)
    - These signs are often placed before a hill or a blind bend.

### Traffic lights at level crossings

## NTK

- The risk of an accident on a moped increases by 25% compared to when driving a passenger car.

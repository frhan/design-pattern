# Stopping, standing still, parking and towing

## **page 1/8**

### Stopping and standing still (waiting)

- Standing still or waiting is defined as remaining stationary strictly only for immediately picking up or setting down one or more passengers and/or immediately loading or unloading goods.
- For cycles (fietsers), light mopeds (snorfietsers) and moped (bromfietsers) the word ‘placing’ is used instead of ‘parking’

The conditions for this standing still/waiting/stopping are that:

- You should remain in the near vicinity of your vehicle
- This standing still/waiting/stopping doesn't take longer than absolutely necessary

- You may stand still/wait on either the right or left hand sides of the road, but for safety reasons the right hand side is preferred
- You may standstill/wait/stop anywhere, except where this is not allowed due to a rule, a sign or a road marking.

**double-parking is not allowed anywhere**

- At a bus stop you may not stop at all, except when stopping for a moment to pick up or set down passengers. You must not (un)load goods There.
- You may not park next to a broken yellow line, but you may stop briefly next to a broken yellow line for loading or unloading goods
- A solid yellow line would have meant: no stopping.

### Important points to consider when wanting to stop or park

When pulling over to stop or park don't forget to:

- Check your rear view mirror.
- Check your outside (door mirror).
- Check your blind spot.
- Indicate direction

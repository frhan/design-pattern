# Stopping, standing still, parking and towing

## **page 1/8**

### Stopping and standing still (waiting)

- Standing still or waiting is defined as remaining stationary strictly only for immediately picking up or setting down one or more passengers and/or immediately loading or unloading goods.
- For cycles (fietsers), light mopeds (snorfietsers) and moped (bromfietsers) the word ‘placing’ is used instead of ‘parking’

The conditions for this standing still/waiting/stopping are that:

- You should remain in the near vicinity of your vehicle
- This standing still/waiting/stopping doesn't take longer than absolutely necessary

- You may stand still/wait on either the right or left hand sides of the road, but for safety reasons the right hand side is preferred
- You may standstill/wait/stop anywhere, except where this is not allowed due to a rule, a sign or a road marking.

**double-parking is not allowed anywhere**

- At a bus stop you may not stop at all, except when stopping for a moment to pick up or set down passengers. You must not (un)load goods There.
- You may not park next to a broken yellow line, but you may stop briefly next to a broken yellow line for loading or unloading goods
- A solid yellow line would have meant: no stopping.

### Important points to consider when wanting to stop or park

When pulling over to stop or park don't forget to:

- Check your rear view mirror.
- Check your outside (door mirror).
- Check your blind spot.
- Indicate direction

### Parking

### How is parking defined?

Parking is defined as stopping other than for:
- Stopping briefly for picking up or setting down passengers.
- Stopping briefly to load or unload goods.

A driver that has stopped outside a shop to deliver such goods is not parking but only stopping, providing that the unloading is immediate and on-going.

- 'placing' must always take place on either the pavement, the footpath, the (grass) verge, a cycle/moped garage, and other areas designated for parking by the authorities; this placement must in no way cause other road users hindrance or dange

### Towing regulations

We can divide towing into two categories:

- Towing a broken down motor vehicle.
- Towing or pulling  a trailer.

regulations apply and which actions you might need to take:
- Drivers of motor vehicles may only tow another motor vehicle if the distance between the two vehicles does not exceed 5 meter
- When the MAM of the trailer exceeds 750 kg, you may still drive this combination of vehicles providing that the total MAM does not exceed 3.500 kg.

## Towing a trailer with a category B driving licence

- always tow a trailer where the maximum authorized mass (MAM) does not exceed 750 kg. 

## Sign C10 indicates that the road is closed to motor vehicles towing trailers.


## The handbrake
- All trailers with a MAM (maximum authorized mass) over 750 kg must be fitted with a handbrake

The safety breakaway cable and safety coupling
If you are towing another vehicle or a trailer (including a boat trailer or a caravan) remember the following points:

- Trailers with a MAM under 750 kg don't need to be fitted with either a safety breakaway cable or a safety coupling, but if present it must be fitted and used properly. You can be fined when failing to do so;

- Trailers with a MAM between 750 kg and 1.500 kg not fitted with a safety breakaway cable, must be fitted with a safety coupling; this must be properly attached and must not be deformed, torn, broken or show signs of considerable wear;

- Safety couplings fitted to trailers with a MAM under 1500 kg must either be attached to a solid part of the pulling vehicle or to a special attachment fitted to the tow bar, so that it will only become effective when the trailer’s coupling fails, whereby the trailer’s drawbar or coupling does not touch the ground;

- Trailers with a MAM between 1.500 kg and 3.500 kg must be fitted with a safety breakaway cable;

- In all case a safety breakaway cable must not be combined with a safety coupling.

## NTK

- Only outside the built-up area must drivers of motor vehicles on more than two wheels use front sidelights and rear lights when stationary at night on the carriageway of a road outside the built-up area and when in parking bays or in parking lanes, on hard shoulders or in refuge bays alongside autowegen (motor roads) and motorways. Case in point: this also applies during daytime when visibility is seriously reduced.

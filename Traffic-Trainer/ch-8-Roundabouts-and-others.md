# Roundabouts and others

## **Page 1**

Sign J9 -> an advance warning for the roundabout ahead.

Sign D1 -> is placed on the roundabout itself.

### Advantages

- Safety
- Operation
- Aesthetics

## **Page 2**

### Approaching roundabouts

- Always look well ahead for the advance warning sign (J9). 
- Priority can vary per roundabout!

### Small roundabouts with one lane

- When exiting the roundabout you must give the right of way to these drivers and also to pedestrians who want to stay on the roundabout; this is because these road users are actually continuing straight ahead on the same road from which you are turning off.

### Roundabouts with two lanes

- Immediately before and on a roundabout all drivers are allowed overtake each other on the left as well as on the right-hand sides.

### Roundabouts with more than two lanes

- use the most appropriate lane on approach and through the roundabout, unless road signs or road markings tell you otherwise.

### Exiting roundabouts

- extra care of the pedal cyclists, snorfietsers (light moped riders) and bromfietsers (moped riders), which might be crossing your path

### Turbo roundabouts

- J37 warns of what is shown on the sub-plate; this sub-plate shows that you can expect _raised carriageway_ dividers ahead. Raised carriageway dividers are one of the characteristics of a turbo roundabout.

### Procedures at roundabouts

#### Going right

- Indicate right as you approach, at about 50 meters before the roundabout. 
- Maintain a right turn signal through the roundabout.

#### Going ahead

- No signal is necessary on approach. 
- Where there three lanes, approach in the centre lane. 
- Indicate right after you have passed the exit just before the one you intend to take.  

#### Going left

- Indicate left as you approach, at about 50 meters before the roundabout. 
- Switch off the indicator after entering the roundabout. 
- Where there two/three lanes, always approach in the left-hand lane. 
- Indicate right after you have passed the exit just before the one you intend to take

### General road placement rules at roundabouts

- In the absence of a cycle/moped path bromfietsers must use the carriageway.
- In the absence of also a cycle lane snorfietsers and fietsers must ride on the carriageway.

### Exceptional traffic rules at roundabouts

#### About overtaking

overtaking is allowed on the: **left** and the **right**.

#### Priority at roundabouts

- A: Priority regulated roundabouts
    - the drivers on the roundabout have the right of way over the drivers entering from their right;
    - Note that this is the case at most of the roundabouts.

- B: Priority non-regulated roundabouts
    - the divers on the roundabout have to give the right of way to drivers entering from the right;
    - Note that roundabouts with this system are in the minority.

### A point to remember about pedestrians at roundabouts

- When a pedestrian is crossing the road on a path which lies inside the roundabout, drivers leaving the roundabout will have to give the right of way to this pedestrian.

- But when a pedestrian is crossing the road on a path which lies outside the roundabout, the pedestrian has to give the right of way to the passenger car.

### Zones

#### The home zone ("Erf" in Dutch; note that the plural is "erven")

- indicated by sign G5
- maximum speed limit of 15 km/h.

#### What is a home zone?

- a shared area for everyone - road users, pedestrians and residents. 
- Normally you will enter or leave a home zone by means of an exit/entrance construction, meaning  that you must give the right of way to all road users approaching from the right, left and ahead.

#### Why have a home zone?

- Encourage a wider range of activities in the street. 

#### Parking within a home zone

 - a home zone motorvehicles and brommobielen may only park at places:
    - In parking squares marked by the letter "P" on the road surface.
    - you may stop anywhere where it is allowed and safe to pick up and set down passengers, but parking is only allowed in areas that are specifically marked for parking.

### 30 km/h zones

- In a 30 km zone you should be on the look-out for pedestrians, pedal cyclists and especially children
- entering or leaving the 30 km/h zone you have to give the right of way to all road users. 
- 30 km/h zones are always inside the built-up area
- There are also 60 km/h zones, which you will only come across outside the built-up areas.

### What's the difference between a 30 km/h maximum speed limit and a 30 km/h zone?

- when entering or leaving the 30 km/h zone you have to give the right of way to all road users. 

- 3o km/h max speed limit, does not have to give the right of way to the pedestrian.

- When the car leaves the 30 km/h zone, the default speed limit will apply again: inside the built-up area 50 km/h.

## **page 10/11**

### Buses inside the built-up area

- you must not overtake the bus, even if there is sufficient room or if there are two lanes; this is because the bus might want to pull over into the left lane to pass an obstacle, to overtake a stationary vehicle or to turn left.  
- This rule only applies inside  the built-up area

### bus and tram stops

- you must not stop, with the exception of stopping briefly to pick up or set down passengers, within 12 metres to either side of the bus stop sign and alongside the possibly present chequered - black/white squares - markings over a maximum distance of 36 meters.

- you must not stop there to for example ask the way, chat to a friend, consult the bus timetable, dispose of litter, post a letter etc.!

- This rule applies both inside and outside the built-up area!

## **page 11/11**

### Bridges and viaducts

- Under wintery conditions there is a greater danger of the roads being slippery on bridges, viaducts and on the motorway slip and link road

### Tunnels

- If your vehicle breaks down in a tunnel, try to drive out of the tunnel; this can sometimes be achieved by driving more slowly. However, when this is not possible, turn on your hazard warning lights and stop on the right side of the tunnel. 

- After coming to a standstill, you must switch your  engine off immediately.

- Before entering a tunnel you must switch on your  dipped beam headlights; this makes you more visible. Don't do this just before entering, because then following drivers might think that you are suddenly braking.

## NTK

- When going right, left or a full circle you should already be indicating; indicate right if going right, and left if going left or a full circle. Case in point: this communicates your intention to your fellow road users well in time!

- priority regulated roundabout means that drivers coming in from the right must give the right of way to all drivers approaching from the right and left on the roundabout.

- Roundabouts with two or more lanes are often constructed as turbo roundabouts

- When you want to leave a roundabout at the second exit you must take up position in the right lane on the approaching road.After passing the first exit you signal to the right and exit.

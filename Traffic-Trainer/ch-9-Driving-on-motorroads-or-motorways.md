# Driving on motorroads or motorways

## **page 1/10**

### Features of motorroads (autowegen) and motorways (autosnelwegen, the “A-roads”)

- motorroad; these roads are indicated by sign G3
- motorway; these roads are indicated by sign G1
- oth of these roads may only be used by drivers of motorvehicles

### Motorroads (autowegen)

- only be used by drivers of motorvehicles that can and may attain a speed of at least 50 km/h
- brommobielen (mobility cars) that have a maximum permitted speed of 45 km/h may not drive on such roads.
- Motorroads can be found both inside and outside built-up areas
- these roads often don't have hard shoulders but only emergency lay-by.
- Default maximum speed limit - 50 km/h inside & 100 outside built-up areas

### Motorways (autosnelwegen)

- used by drivers of motorvehicles that can and may attain a speed of at least 60 km/h

- can only be found outside built-up areas and will always have junctions at different levels, aeroducts, ecoducts, fly-overs and viaducts

- the road will always be divided into two or more separate carriageways.

- these roads have hard shoulders and emergency lay-by's when the hard shoulder is being used as a rush hour lane.

- Default maximum speed limit - 130 km/h

- these are the so-called “A” roads,stands for “autosnelweg

- HGV’s (heavy goods vehicles: lorries & trucks), that have a maximum speed of 80 km/h on all motorways

### The following areas, when situated alongside a motorway are not a part of the motorway:

- Parking areas.
- Bus stops.
- Petrol stations.

### Road and lane placement

- On motorways with two lanes you must always drive on the right-hand lane

- unless there are legal and valid circumstances for deviating from this rule, e.g. overtaking or positioning for a different direction. Use the centre or the left-hand lane only for overtaking.

- After overtaking, you must move back to the right-hand lane.

- when you are moving back to the other lane you have to indicate your intentions to other road users.

- When you are driving on the right-hand lane and other drivers want to join the motorway, check if these drivers have enough possibilities to do so.

- When it is impossible for them, deviate to the middle lane (if it is safe) to let that traffic merge onto the motorway.

### What must you not do on motorroads and motorways?

On motorroads and motorways you must not:

- Reverse
- Turn.
- Stop on the carriageway.
- Stop your vehicle.
- Use or walk on the hard shoulder, emergency bay, refuge bay, except in case of an emergency.

Use the third and following lanes if you are driving a (heavy) goods vehicle or a vehicle pulling a trailer, when the overall length exceeds 7 meters.

### Accident and incident management

- If you are involved in an accident with only limited or material damages, you must leave the through carriageway as soon as possible; you should proceed to the nearest parking area to exchange the relevant information and vacate the lane or hard shoulder of the motorway.

### Rush hour lanes

- A rush hour lane on the right is created by opening up the hard shoulder; on the left this is done by creating an additional, less wide, lane. 
- During the opening of the rush hour lane a lower speed will be imposed.
- The longer white lines separating the rush hour lane
from the centre lane indicate that this left most, plus, lane
can be opened as a rush hour lane.

### About driving on motorways

#### Concentration

- fatigue accounts for 15-20% of accidents on monotonous roads
- Remember it’s an offence to stop on the hard shoulder, an exit or a slip road, unless in an emergency.

#### Your vehicle

The following vehicles must not be used on the motorway:

- Agricultural vehicles.
- Brommobielen and invalid carriages.
- Snorfietsen and bromfietsen.
- Special types of mopeds and other certain slow-moving vehicles.
- Pedestrians, pedal cyclists and horse riders.

### Motorway signs and signals leading to the motorway

#### Joining the motorroad or motorway

- when joining you have to give the right of way to the traffic already on the through carriageway.
- Drivers on the through carriageway are not obliged to change lanes to the left when another driver wants to merge.

- at very short acceleration lanes you should stop at the beginning if it is not possible to join the motorway immediately.

- you should only indicate your intention to enter the motorroad or motorway after having determined that it's safe and clear to do  

### Important points when joining the motorway

- Signal only just before joining the motorway. 
- Cancel the signal (indicator) immediately when you are on the through carriageway.

### Leaving the motorway

- you will leave the through carriageway

- Get into the lane that will be adjacent to the deceleration lane at about 600 meters in advance and then signal your intention to leave at 300 meters before the beginning of the deceleration lane

- Drivers that have chosen the deceleration lane to apparently leave the motorway are not allowed to re-join; they must continue as planned and leave!

### Important points when leaving the motorway

- Signal in good time before the exit.
- Do not apply the brakes on the through carriageway.
- Reduce your speed when you have reached the slip road.

### Joining or leaving by means of a combined acceleration/deceleration lane

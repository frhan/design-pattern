Creating Nested Classes
----

A _nested class_ is a class that is defined within another class. A nested class that is not static is called an _inner class_. 

There are four of types of nested classes:

* A member inner class is a class defined at the same level as instance variables. It is not static. Often, this is just referred to as an inner class without explicitly saying the type.
* A local inner class is defined within a method.
* An anonymous inner class is a special case of a local inner class that does not have a name.
* A static nested class is a static class that is defined at the same level as static variables.

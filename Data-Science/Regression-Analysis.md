Regression Analysis
what is regression analysis?
 - is a way of mathematically sorting out which variable does indeed have an impact on decision/sales etc

Two factors are called variables
 dependent variable: main factor to understand and predict
 independent variable: the factors you suspect have an impact on your dependent variable.

how does it work?
 - plotting your data is the first step in figuring that out.
 - building a regression model
     - draw a regression line
     - the line is the best explanation of the relationship between the independent variable and dependent variable.

How do companies use it?
 - smart companies uses it to make all sorts of business issues
 - explain a phenomenon they want to understand (eg. why did customer service calls drop last month?);
 - predict things about the future (e.g. what will sales look like over the next six months?);
 - or to decide what to do (e.g. should we go with this promotion or a different one?).

Correlation is not causation
-  It’s easy to say that there is a correlation between rain and monthly sales. The regression shows that they are indeed related. But it’s an entirely different thing to say that rain caused the sales.
 - The goal is not to figure out what is going on in the data but to figure out is what is going on in the world.

What mistakes do people make when working with regression analysis?
 - First, don’t tell your data analyst to go out and figure out what is affecting sales.
 - Second , analyses are very sensitive to bad data
 - You always have to lay your intuition on top of the data

You need to pair any analysis with study of real world. The best scientists — and managers — look at both.

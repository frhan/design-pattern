Machine learning
What is machine learning?
is the idea that there are generic algorithms that can tell you something interesting about a set of data without you having to write any custom code specific to the problem.
Instead of writing code, you feed data to the generic algorithm and it builds its own logic based on the data.


Two kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms
In supervised learning
letting the computer work out that relationship for you.
And once you know what math was required to solve this specific set of problems, you could answer to any other problem of the same type!
